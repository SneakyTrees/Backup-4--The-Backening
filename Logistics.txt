BAFTA awards talkin about Dragon Age Origins prepearing for the war wiwth your soldiers, thought it would be way more interesting and realistic toa ctually do armies with supply n stuff

Player is expected to adapt to the changing situation as the war progresses and resource availability shifts. Player will have to make real choices about which supply/army/routes/etc. to use. Transportation comes in many forms, but is limited and change by things like fuel, weather, and time of year/day. Player receives information (can be correct or incorrect, the player can assess the situation themselves and decide if they want) from the army in the field
