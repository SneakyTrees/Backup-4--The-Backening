if(points[i] is in perf box)
	remove point
	i--

convert arraylist

return array of points with all those inside the perf box removed from it


currentValidPOints
currentTestingPoints = removePointsInPerfBox;
if(currentTestingPoints.length == 0)
	return currentTestingPoints

inc hypotenuse and inner
cnotinue

whe ndone with perfect boxes, return currentValidPoints array

Add a mutual anyPointsAreInBox check as first of checks

if(
anyPointsAreInBox(<points from comparing>)
anyPointsAreInBox(<corners from this>)
)

	return true;
